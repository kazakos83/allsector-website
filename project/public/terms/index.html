	<h2 id="client-terms">Part A – Client Terms &amp; Conditions <span class="tag">Clients</span></h2>

	<h3>A1. Role of Allsector</h3>
	<p>
	  Allsector operates as a <strong>facilities management and coordination provider</strong>.
	  Unless expressly agreed in writing, Allsector does not perform licensed building or trade work and does not act as the licensed contractor for regulated works.
	  Allsector’s role is limited to coordinating services performed by independent contractors.
	</p>

	<h3>A2. Independent Contractors</h3>
	<p>
	  All services coordinated by Allsector are performed by independent contractors.
	  Contractors are not employees, agents, partners, or joint venturers of Allsector and have no authority to bind or represent Allsector.
	</p>

	<h3>A3. Licensed Works &amp; Responsibility</h3>
	<p>
	  Where services require licensing or registration under applicable law, including but not limited to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991 (Qld)</li>
	  <li>Home Building Act 1989 (NSW)</li>
	  <li>Building Act 1993 (Vic)</li>
	</ul>

	  <li>Perform work only within the scope of their licence or registration</li>
	  <li><strong>Hold themselves out as the licensed parties</strong> responsible for the work they perform</li>

	<h3>A4. Reliance on Contractor Representations</h3>
	<p>
	  Allsector is entitled to rely entirely on contractor representations, warranties, and conduct regarding licensing, compliance, and regulatory requirements.
	  To the extent permitted by law, Allsector has no obligation to supervise, audit, monitor, or continuously verify a contractor’s licensing status.
	</p>

	<h3>A5. No Reliance on Allsector for Licensing or Legal Advice</h3>

	<ul>
	  <li>Whether a licence is required</li>
	  <li>The appropriate licence class</li>
	  <li>The scope of work permitted under any licence</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Independent professional advice should be obtained where required.
	</p>

	<h3>A6. Client Acknowledgements</h3>
	<p>
	  By requesting or permitting works to proceed, the client acknowledges and agrees that:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Allsector acts solely as a coordinator</li>
	  <li>Contractors performing the work are responsible for licensing, compliance, and workmanship</li>
	  <li>Allsector does not assume the statutory obligations of a licensed contractor where it is not the party performing the licensed work</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- ========================= -->
	<!-- PART B – CONTRACTORS      -->
	<!-- ========================= -->
	<h2 id="contractor-terms">Part B – Contractor Conditions <span class="tag">Contractors</span></h2>

	<h3>B1. Independent Contractor Status</h3>
	<p>
	  The contractor (“Contractor”, “you”, “your”) is engaged as an independent contractor, not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of Allsector.
	  The Contractor is solely responsible for all tax, superannuation, insurances, licensing, registrations, and statutory obligations and has no authority to bind or represent Allsector.
	</p>

	<h3>B2. Licensing, Regulatory Compliance &amp; “Licensee Holding Out”</h3>
	<p>
	  The Contractor warrants that they hold, and will maintain for the duration of any engagement, all licences, registrations, and approvals required by law to perform the services,
	  including (where applicable) licences required under the QBCC Act (Qld), Home Building Act (NSW), and Building Act (Vic).
	  The Contractor must not perform work outside the scope of their licence class or registration.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Contractor bears <strong>sole and primary responsibility</strong> for ensuring licensing and regulatory compliance for the work they perform</li>
	  <li>The Contractor <strong>holds themselves out as the appropriately licensed party</strong> performing any regulated work</li>
	  <li>Allsector acts solely as a facilities management and coordination provider and is not the licensee unless expressly stated in writing</li>
	  <li>Allsector is entitled to <strong>rely entirely</strong> on the Contractor’s representations, warranties, and conduct regarding licensing and compliance</li>
	  <li>Allsector has <strong>no obligation</strong> to supervise, monitor, audit, or continuously verify the Contractor’s licensing status</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Any failure to hold or maintain required licensing constitutes a <strong>material breach</strong>.
	  The Contractor must immediately notify Allsector of any suspension, cancellation, restriction, condition, investigation, or proposed disciplinary action affecting their licence.
	</p>

	<h3>B3. No Reliance on Allsector for Licence Advice</h3>
	<p>
	  The Contractor acknowledges that Allsector does not provide legal, regulatory, or licensing advice.
	  The Contractor must make their own independent enquiries to ensure compliance with all applicable licensing and regulatory requirements and must not rely on Allsector for guidance as to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Whether a licence is required</li>
	  <li>The appropriate licence class</li>
	  <li>The scope of work permitted under any licence</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>B4. Confidentiality</h3>
	<p>
	  All non-public information relating to Allsector, including client identities and contacts, pricing, rates, margins, scopes, systems, templates, and processes, is confidential.
	  The Contractor must not disclose, use, or exploit Confidential Information except for performing services for Allsector. This obligation survives termination.
	</p>

	<h3>B5. Client Communication &amp; Commercial Control</h3>
	<p>
	  The Contractor must not discuss pricing, variations, discounts, or scope changes with any client; negotiate directly with any client; or represent themselves as the contracting party instead of Allsector.
	  All commercial matters must be redirected to authorised Allsector staff. Failure to comply is a <strong>material breach</strong>.
	</p>

	<h3>B6. Non-Solicitation &amp; Circumvention</h3>
	<p>
	  During engagement and for <strong>12 months</strong> after the last date of work, the Contractor must not solicit, approach, accept work from, or circumvent Allsector in respect of any Allsector client,
	  directly or indirectly, or assist any third party to do so.
	</p>

	<h3>B7. Limited Non-Compete</h3>
	<p>
	  During engagement and for <strong>6 months</strong> after termination, the Contractor must not provide facilities management or coordinated maintenance services that compete with Allsector to any Allsector client
	  in any State or Territory where services were performed for Allsector. This does not restrict unrelated general trade work.
	</p>

	<h3>B8. No Poaching</h3>
	<p>
	  The Contractor must not, during engagement or for <strong>12 months</strong> after termination, solicit or engage Allsector employees, contractors, or key suppliers where it undermines Allsector’s commercial relationships.
	</p>

	<h3>B9. Insurance</h3>
	<p>
	  The Contractor must maintain, at their own cost, the following as applicable:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Public Liability Insurance (minimum $20,000,000)</li>
	  <li>Workers Compensation Insurance (as required by law)</li>
	  <li>Any other insurance required by law or reasonably necessary for the services</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Evidence must be provided on request and kept current.</p>

	<h3>B10. Intellectual Property</h3>
	<p>
	  All documents, reports, photographs, scopes, data, and work product created in connection with services for Allsector are the property of Allsector unless otherwise agreed in writing.
	</p>

	<h3>B11. Breach, Termination &amp; Indemnity</h3>
	<p>
	  Allsector may immediately suspend or terminate engagement for breach.
	  The Contractor indemnifies Allsector against all claims, losses, penalties, fines, damages, and costs arising from:
	  unlicensed or non-compliant work; breach of these Terms &amp; Conditions; or regulatory/enforcement action relating to the Contractor’s services.
	  This indemnity survives termination.
	</p>
