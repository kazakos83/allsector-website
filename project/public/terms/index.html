    <h1>Allsector – Client Terms & Contractor Conditions</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      Version 1.0<br>
      Effective Date: 15 January 2026<br>
      Last Updated: 15 January 2026
    </div>

    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions apply to all services coordinated by <strong>Allsector Pty Ltd</strong>
      (“Allsector”, “we”, “us”, “our”). They apply to all clients, contractors, subcontractors,
      and trades engaged in connection with any work request, quote, work order, or service.
    </p>

    <p>
      By requesting services, accepting a quote, issuing a work request, permitting works to proceed,
      or performing services, the relevant party agrees to be bound by these Terms & Conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Role of Allsector</h2>
    <p>
      Allsector operates as a <strong>facilities management and coordination provider</strong>.
      Unless expressly agreed in writing, Allsector does not perform licensed building or trade work
      and does not act as the licensed contractor for regulated works.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Independent Contractors</h2>
    <p>
      All services coordinated by Allsector are performed by independent contractors.
      Contractors are not employees, agents, partners, or joint venturers of Allsector and
      have no authority to bind or represent Allsector.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Licensing & Regulatory Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Where services require licensing or registration under applicable law, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991 (Qld)</li>
      <li>Home Building Act 1989 (NSW)</li>
      <li>Building Act 1993 (Vic)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      such services are performed by contractors who:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold all required licences, registrations, and approvals</li>
      <li>Perform work only within the scope of their licence or registration</li>
      <li><strong>Hold themselves out as the licensed parties</strong> responsible for the work they perform</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Responsibility for licensing, regulatory compliance, and workmanship rests solely with the
      contractor performing the work.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Reliance on Contractor Representations</h2>
    <p>
      Allsector is entitled to rely entirely on contractor representations, warranties, and conduct
      regarding licensing, compliance, and regulatory requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, Allsector has no obligation to supervise, audit, monitor,
      or continuously verify a contractor’s licensing status.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Reliance on Allsector for Licensing or Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Allsector does not provide legal, regulatory, or licensing advice.
      Neither clients nor contractors may rely on Allsector for advice regarding:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether a licence is required</li>
      <li>The appropriate licence class</li>
      <li>The scope of work permitted under any licence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Independent professional advice should be obtained where required.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Client Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>
      By requesting or permitting works to proceed, the client acknowledges and agrees that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allsector acts solely as a coordinator</li>
      <li>Contractors performing the work are responsible for licensing, compliance, and workmanship</li>
      <li>Allsector does not assume the statutory obligations of a licensed contractor where it is not the party performing the work</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      All non-public information relating to Allsector, including client details, pricing,
      scopes, systems, and processes, is confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contractors must not disclose, use, or exploit such information except for performing
      services for Allsector. This obligation survives termination.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Client & Commercial Control (Contractors)</h2>
    <p>
      Contractors must not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discuss pricing, variations, or scope changes with any client</li>
      <li>Negotiate directly with any client</li>
      <li>Represent themselves as the contracting party instead of Allsector</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All commercial matters must be referred to authorised Allsector staff.
      Any breach constitutes a <strong>material breach</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Non-Solicitation & Circumvention</h2>
    <p>
      During engagement and for 12 months after the last date of work, contractors must not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Solicit or accept work from any Allsector client</li>
      <li>Circumvent Allsector to provide competing services</li>
      <li>Assist any third party to do so</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Limited Non-Compete</h2>
    <p>
      During engagement and for 6 months after termination, contractors must not provide facilities
      management or coordinated maintenance services that compete with Allsector to any Allsector
      client in any State or Territory where services were performed.
    </p>

    <h2>11. No Poaching</h2>
    <p>
      Contractors must not, during engagement or for 12 months after termination, solicit or engage
      Allsector employees, contractors, or key suppliers where it undermines Allsector’s relationships.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Contractors must maintain, at their own cost:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public Liability Insurance (minimum $20 million)</li>
      <li>Workers Compensation Insurance (where required)</li>
      <li>Any other insurance required by law or reasonably necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All documents, reports, photographs, data, and work product created in connection with services
      coordinated by Allsector are the property of Allsector unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Breach, Termination & Indemnity</h2>
    <p>
      Allsector may immediately suspend or terminate engagement for breach.
      Contractors indemnify Allsector against all claims, losses, penalties, fines, damages, and costs
      arising from unlicensed work, breach of these terms, or regulatory action.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of the State or Territory in which the services
      are performed.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
      Acceptance of a work request, quote, work order, invoice, or commencement of works constitutes
      acceptance of these Terms & Conditions.
